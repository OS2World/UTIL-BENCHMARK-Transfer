TRANSFER.EXE    -       OS/2 Data transfer test

Transfer is an OS/2 only program that does a data transfer test
measurement on OS/2 disks.

Transfer set's itself at the highest priority and then reads
repeatedly from the disk.  It then calculated the data transfered
in K per second.  It uses the OS/2 clock for measurement.

Transfer was compiled using MS 'C' version 6.0 .  Source and makefile is 
included so you can make it yourself.  Try changing it so it reads at 
a different spot on the disk.
